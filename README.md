Description
This project demonstrates clean, accessible, and responsive front-end structure using semantic HTML and modern CSS. It features:
    • A header with a navigation menu linking to internal sections
    • A Projects section with a captioned table (using <caption>, <colgroup>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>)
    • A Contact section with an accessible form (labels, required fields, keyboard-friendly focus)
    • Flexbox layout for navigation, main content, and the contact form
    • Hover/transition effects and media queries for responsiveness
